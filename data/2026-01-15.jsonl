An important theoretical tool, the main obstacle to its widespread usage is the computational cost required to match the ever-increasing scale of the data being analyzed. Many of these difficulties have been overcome in the past two decades, which have consequently seen the development of increasingly sophisticated ARG simulation and inference software. Nonetheless, challenges remain, especially in the area of ancestry inference. This paper is a comprehensive review of ARG samplers that have emerged in the past three decades to meet the need for scalable and flexible ancestry simulation and inference solutions. It specifically focuses on their performance, usability, and the biological realism of the underlying algorithm, and aims primarily to provide a technical overview of the field for researchers seeking to write their own coalescent-with-recombination sampler. As a complement to this article, we have compiled links to software, source code and documentation and made them available at https://www.patrickfournier.ca/arg-samplers-review/graph."}
