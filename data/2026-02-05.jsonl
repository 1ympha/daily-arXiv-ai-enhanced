A mini-review submitted to Communications in Theoretical Physics. Comments are appreciated", "summary": "Cooperation, fairness, trust, and resource coordination are cornerstones of modern civilization, yet their emergence remains inadequately explained by the persistent discrepancies between theoretical predictions and behavioral experiments. Part of this gap may arise from the imitation learning paradigm commonly used in prior theoretical models, which assumes individuals merely copy successful neighbors according to predetermined, fixed rules. This review examines recent advances in evolutionary game dynamics that employ reinforcement learning (RL) as an alternative paradigm. In RL, individuals learn through trial and error and introspectively refine their strategies based on environmental feedback. We begin by introducing key concepts in evolutionary game theory and the two learning paradigms, then synthesize progress in applying RL to elucidate cooperation, trust, fairness, optimal resource coordination, and ecological dynamics. Collectively, these studies indicate that RL offers a promising unified framework for understanding the diverse social and ecological phenomena observed in human and natural systems."}

This study revisits 226 peer-reviewed articles drawn from two global systematic reviews on island ecosystem services and climate change, applying a structured post hoc analysis to evaluate how uncertainty is treated across methods, service categories, ecosystem realms, and decision contexts. Studies were classified according to whether uncertainty was explicitly analysed, just mentioned, or ignored. Only 30 percent of studies incorporated uncertainty explicitly, while more than half did not address it at all. Scenario-based approaches dominated uncertainty assessment, whereas probabilistic and ensemble-based frameworks remained limited. Cultural ecosystem services and extreme climate impacts exhibited the lowest levels of uncertainty integration, and few studies connected uncertainty treatment to policy relevant decision frameworks. Weak or absent treatment of uncertainty emerges as a structural challenge in island systems, where narrow ecological thresholds, strong land-sea coupling, limited spatial buffers, and reduced institutional redundancy amplify the consequences of decision-making under incomplete knowledge. Systematic mapping of how uncertainty is framed, operationalised, or neglected reveals persistent methodological and conceptual gaps and informs concrete directions for strengthening uncertainty integration in future island-focused ecosystem service and climate assessments. Embedding uncertainty more robustly into modelling practices, participatory processes, and policy tools is essential for enhancing scientific credibility, governance relevance, and adaptive capacity in insular socio-ecological systems."}

Bridging this gap increasingly requires transitioning from DNA-only interpretation to multi-modal diagnostic reasoning that combines genomic data, transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq), and phenotype information; however, computational frameworks that coherently integrate these signals remain limited. Here we present RareCollab, an agentic diagnostic framework that pairs a stable quantitative Diagnostic Engine with Large Language Model (LLM)-based specialist modules that produce high-resolution, interpretable assessments from transcriptomic signals, phenotypes, variant databases, and the literature to prioritize potential diagnostic variants. In a rigorously curated benchmark of Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) patients with paired genomic and transcriptomic data, RareCollab achieved 77% top-5 diagnostic accuracy and improved top-1 to top-5 accuracy by ~20% over widely used variant-prioritization approaches. RareCollab illustrates how modular artificial intelligence (AI) can operationalize multi-modal evidence for accurate, scalable rare disease diagnosis, offering a promising path toward reducing the diagnostic odyssey for affected families."}

Current screening relies on subjective questionnaires (PSS-10), limiting continuous monitoring. We developed deep learning models for stress detection from electrocardiography (ECG) using the FELICITy 1 cohort (151 pregnant women, 32-38 weeks gestation). A ResNet-34 encoder was pretrained via SimCLR contrastive learning on 40,692 ECG segments per subject. Multi-layer feature extraction enabled binary classification and continuous PSS prediction across maternal (mECG), fetal (fECG), and abdominal ECG (aECG). External validation used the FELICITy 2 RCT (28 subjects, different ECG device, yoga intervention vs. control). On FELICITy 1 (5-fold CV): mECG 98.6% accuracy (R2=0.88, MAE=1.90), fECG 99.8% (R2=0.95, MAE=1.19), aECG 95.5% (R2=0.75, MAE=2.80). External validation on FELICITy 2: mECG 77.3% accuracy (R2=0.62, MAE=3.54, AUC=0.826), aECG 63.6% (R2=0.29, AUC=0.705). Signal quality-based channel selection outperformed all-channel averaging (+12% R2 improvement). Mixed-effects models detected a significant intervention response (p=0.041). Self-supervised deep learning on pregnancy ECG enables accurate, objective stress assessment, with multi-layer feature extraction substantially outperforming single embedding approaches."}

While Molecular Dynamics (MD) is essential for elucidating this transduction process, particularly within ligand-bound complexes, conventional all-atom MD simulation is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we introduce GPCRLMD, a deep generative framework for efficient all-atom GPCR-ligand simulation.GPCRLMD employs a Harmonic-Prior Variational Autoencoder (HP-VAE) to first map the complex into a regularized isometric latent space, preserving geometric topology via physics-informed constraints. Within this latent space, a Residual Latent Flow samples evolution trajectories, which are subsequently decoded back to atomic coordinates. By capturing temporal dynamics via relative displacements anchored to the initial structure, this residual mechanism effectively decouples static topology from dynamic fluctuations. Experimental results demonstrate that GPCRLMD achieves state-of-the-art performance in GPCR-ligand dynamics simulation, faithfully reproducing thermodynamic observables and critical ligand-receptor interactions."}
