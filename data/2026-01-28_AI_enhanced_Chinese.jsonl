A key challenge in achieving this goal is having access to robust methodologies to understand where species occur and how they relate to each other within broader ecological communities. Recent deep learning-based advances in joint species distribution modeling have shown improved predictive performance, but effectively incorporating community-level learning, taking into account species-species relationships in addition to species-environment relationships, remains an outstanding challenge. We introduce LabelKAN, a novel framework based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to learn inter-label connections from predictions of each label. When modeling avian species distributions, LabelKAN achieves substantial gains in predictive performance across the vast majority of species. In particular, our method demonstrates strong improvements for rare and difficult-to-predict species, which are often the most important when setting biodiversity targets under frameworks like GBF. These performance gains also translate to more confident predictions of the species spatial patterns as well as more confident predictions of community structure. We illustrate how the LabelKAN leads to qualitative and quantitative improvements with a focused application on the Great Blue Heron, an emblematic species in freshwater ecosystems that has experienced significant population declines across the United States in recent years. Using the LabelKAN framework, we are able to identify communities and species in New York that will be most sensitive to further declines in Great Blue Heron populations.", "AI": {"tldr": "LabelKAN\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov-Arnold Networks\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u7b7e\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u7a00\u6709\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6b63\u5728\u52a0\u901f\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u7fa4\u843d\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8054\u5408\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6709\u6240\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u7fa4\u843d\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u8003\u8651\u7269\u79cd\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLabelKAN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov-Arnold Networks\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u6807\u7b7e\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u7269\u79cd\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8fd8\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u7269\u79cd\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\uff0cLabelKAN\u5728\u7edd\u5927\u591a\u6570\u7269\u79cd\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u7a00\u6709\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u81ea\u4fe1\u7684\u7269\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u683c\u5c40\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7fa4\u843d\u7ed3\u6784\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "LabelKAN\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7269\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5bf9\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4fdd\u62a4\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u7a00\u6709\u7269\u79cd\uff0c\u4e3aGBF\u7b49\u751f\u7269\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u4fdd\u62a4\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, there are many information gaps about vehicle movements patterns that increase the probability of disease transmission, which is crucial in developing better preventive strategies. In this study we described the movement pattern of vehicle cabs and trailers and identified risk factors for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) farm's infectious status. We collected global positioning system (GPS) movement data from vehicle cabs and trailers for 18 months and basic information for 6621 farms in the U.S. For the vehicle movement data, we estimated 66 variables and evaluate their association with farms PRRS and PED status. Our univariate analysis showed that 56 variables were significant associated (p < 0.05) to PED and PRRS farm status. Within these variables, vehicle visit frequency and previous exposition to positive farms were the main risk factors for both diseases. Otherwise, increased vehicle cab and trailer loyalty for farm shipments and vehicle cleaning and disinfection events were protective factors. In the multivariate model, each additional weekly visit by a vehicle cab that had been exposed to a positive farm one day before the shipment was associated with a 234\\% and 243\\% increase in the odds of a farm testing PRRS- and PED-positive, respectively. Our analysis revealed that vehicle contact history play a crucial role in the transmission of PRRS and PED.

In post-bisulfite library construction, Adaptase-mediated tailing blurs the boundary between biological sequence and synthetic additions, rendering read trimming a persistent source of variability across analytical pipelines. We show that this variability reflects an intrinsic limit of per-read boundary inference rather than an algorithmic shortcoming: boundary localization is fundamentally asymmetric between paired-end reads, with Read 2 exhibiting kinetically structured artifacts that support constrained read-level inference, while apparent contamination in Read 1 arises conditionally from geometry-driven read-through events and is not well-defined at the single-read level. Even within Read 2, bisulfite-induced compositional degeneracy creates an indistinguishable regime in which genomic and synthetic origins share support under the same observable sequence evidence, implying a strictly positive Bayes error under any deterministic per-read decision rule and placing a fundamental limit on per-read boundary fidelity. By explicitly characterizing these limits, we reframe read trimming in ssWGBS as a constrained inference problem and introduce a conservative framework that operates only where supported by observable evidence (including short-range nucleotide texture), exposes interpretable trade-offs between genomic retention and residual artifact risk, and avoids forced resolution where boundaries are intrinsically unresolvable. Together, these results clarify why fixed trimming heuristics persist in practice and provide a principled foundation for uncertainty-aware preprocessing in ssWGBS.", "AI": {"tldr": "ssWGBS\u6d4b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u9176\u4fc3\u4f2a\u5f71\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bfb\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0cRead 2\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u800cRead 1\u5b58\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc1\u636e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u94fe\u5168\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u4e9a\u786b\u9178\u6c22\u76d0\u6d4b\u5e8f\uff08ssWGBS\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4f4e\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7247\u6bb5\u5316\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884cDNA\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u9176\u4fc3\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4f7f\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u590d\u6742\u5316\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662fAdaptase\u4ecb\u5bfc\u7684\u52a0\u5c3e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u7cca\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6dfb\u52a0\u7269\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bfb\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u6210\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790ssWGBS\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Read 2\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u6027\u8bfb\u6bb5\u7ea7\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u800cRead 1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\u5219\u6e90\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bfb\u7a7f\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u4e9a\u786b\u9178\u6c22\u76d0\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6210\u5206\u9000\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u66b4\u9732\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u6b8b\u7559\u4f2a\u5f71\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86ssWGBS\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1aRead 1\u548cRead 2\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0cRead 2\u652f\u6301\u7ea6\u675f\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u800cRead 1\u4f2a\u5f71\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b\u5b58\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4efb\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bfb\u6bb5\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u90fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u6b63\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u56fa\u5b9a\u4fee\u526a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f55\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c06ssWGBS\u4e2d\u7684\u8bfb\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fdd\u5b88\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4ec5\u5728\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bc1\u636e\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u6b8b\u7559\u4f2a\u5f71\u98ce\u9669\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u6790\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5236\u89e3\u6790\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3assWGBS\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We present LvD, (Likelihood via Decomposition), an alternative to Felsenstein's algorithm based on a different decomposition of the underlying phylogeny. It works for all standard nucleotide models. The new algorithm allows updates of the likelihood calculation in worst case $O(\\log n)$ time with $n$ taxa, as opposed to worst case $O(n)$ time for existing methods. In practice this leads to appreciable improvements in likelihood calculations, the extent of speed-up depending on how balanced or unbalanced the trees are. We explore implications for parallel computing, and show that the approach allows likelihoods to be computed in $O(\\log n)$ parallel time per site, compared to (worst case) $O(n)$ time. We implemented and applied the algorithm to large numbers of simulated and empirical data sets and showed that these theoretical advances lead to a significant practical speed-up, although the extent of the improvement depends on how balanced the phylogenies already are.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLvD\u7b97\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3Felsenstein\u526a\u679d\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u5f0f\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u6811\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(n)\u964d\u81f3O(log n)\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6", "motivation": "Felsenstein\u7684\u526a\u679d\u6cd5\uff081973\uff09\u662f\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e2d\u6700\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u6811\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLvD\uff08Likelihood via Decomposition\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u6811\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u6838\u82f7\u9178\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u65b0", "result": "LvD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\u66f4\u65b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4eceO(n)\u964d\u81f3O(log n)\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6811\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u3002\u5728\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u70b9\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u4e5f\u4eceO(n)\u964d\u81f3O(log n)", "conclusion": "LvD\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e0a\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6811\u7ed3\u6784"}}

We hypothesize that this misalignment drives tumors toward a distinct architectural regime, termed hyperdisorder. Hyperdisorder is not defined by increased heterogeneity alone, but by the coexistence of elevated disorder across scales and spatial nonstationarity within the same tumor. Unlike ordinary randomness, where independent fluctuations diminish under spatial averaging, disorder here persists, reorganizes, or even amplifies with increasing observation scale, preventing convergence toward a stable architectural description. Using hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images of gastric cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we quantify tumor architecture using tile-based metrics that capture complementary aspects of organization, including texture entropy, microstructural fragmentation, orientation isotropy, and multiscale entropy variation. These measures are combined into a standardized hyperdisorder index, enabling unsupervised comparison across spatial regions. We find that architectural disruption is unevenly distributed and partially decoupled across scales within individual slides, consistent with growth-driven multiscale incoherence rather than uniform stochastic variability. Testable consequences include anomalous scaling of heterogeneity with sampling size, failure of coarse graining to converge, and systematic differences between tumor cores and invasive fronts. In diagnostic and clinical contexts, this framework clarifies when measurements from limited tissue samples are representative of the whole tumor and when they are dominated by scale- and location-dependent effects.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8d85\u65e0\u5e8f\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u80bf\u7624\u5728\u7ec6\u80de\u3001\u4ecb\u89c2\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u673a\u68b0\u548c\u4ee3\u8c22\u56e0\u7d20\u5931\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u7d0a\u4e71\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7d0a\u4e71\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u751a\u81f3\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u80bf\u7624\u751f\u957f\u53d7\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u673a\u68b0\u548c\u4ee3\u8c22\u56e0\u7d20\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u80bf\u7624\u6269\u5f20\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u9010\u6e10\u5931\u8c03\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u8fd9\u79cd\u5931\u8c03\u5bfc\u81f4\u80bf\u7624\u8fdb\u5165\u4e00\u79cd\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u72b6\u6001\u2014\u2014\u8d85\u65e0\u5e8f\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u72b6\u6001\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u66f4\u662f\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7d0a\u4e71\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u7684\u5171\u5b58\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u764c\u75c7\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u80c3\u764cH&E\u67d3\u8272\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u5757\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u6355\u6349\u80bf\u7624\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7eb9\u7406\u71b5\u3001\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u71b5\u53d8\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u8d85\u65e0\u5e8f\u6307\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u67b6\u6784\u7834\u574f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u5185\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u751f\u957f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u5f02\u3002\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u540e\u679c\u5305\u62ec\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u968f\u91c7\u6837\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u7f29\u653e\u3001\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u80bf\u7624\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u4fb5\u88ad\u524d\u6cbf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u6709\u9650\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u4ee3\u8868\u6574\u4e2a\u80bf\u7624\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u53d7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6548\u5e94\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002\u8d85\u65e0\u5e8f\u6982\u5ff5\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u80bf\u7624\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5bf9\u80bf\u7624\u53d6\u6837\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Part 1: Simulations on global, biophysically-realistic genotype-phenotype maps", "comment": "Invited review (Part I of a two-part series), submitted to Current Opinion in Genetics & Development", "summary": "Promoters and enhancers are cis-regulatory elements (CREs), DNA sequences that bind transcription factor (TF) proteins to up- or down-regulate target genes. Decades-long efforts yielded TF-DNA interaction models that predict how strongly an individual TF binds arbitrary DNA sequences and how individual binding events on the CRE combine to affect gene expression. These insights can be synthesized into a global, biophysically-realistic, and quantitative genotype-phenotype (GP) map for gene regulation, a \"holy grail\" for the application of evolutionary theory. A global map provides a rare opportunity to simulate long-term evolution of regulatory sequences and pose several fundamental questions: How long does it take to evolve CREs de novo? How many non-trivial regulatory functions exist in sequence space? How connected are they? For which regulatory architecture is CRE evolution most rapid and evolvable? In this article, the first of a two-part series, we briefly review the pertinent modeling and simulation efforts for a unique system that enables close, quantitative, and mechanistic links between biophysics, as well as systems, synthetic, and evolutionary biology.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8f6c\u5f55\u56e0\u5b50-DNA\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u3001\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u578b-\u8868\u578b\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u63a7\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8fdb\u5316", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u3001\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u578b-\u8868\u578b\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u8fdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u5e94\u7528\u7684\"\u5723\u676f\"\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u56de\u7b54\u5173\u4e8e\u8c03\u63a7\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u56de\u987e\u6570\u5341\u5e74\u6765\u5173\u4e8e\u8f6c\u5f55\u56e0\u5b50-DNA\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5f55\u56e0\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408DNA\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7efc\u5408\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u7684\u57fa\u56e0\u578b-\u8868\u578b\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u8c03\u63a7\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8fdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u662f\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u7bc7\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u5408\u6210\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u8fdb\u5316\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u673a\u5236\u8054\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6"}}
