Mathematical models are crucial for supporting timely and reliable evidence generation for public health decision-making with models spanning approaches from compartmental and metapopulation models to detailed agent-based simulations. Yet, the accompanying software ecosystem remains fragmented across model types, spatial resolutions, and computational targets, making models harder to compare, extend, and deploy at scale. Here we present MEmilio, a modular, high-performance framework for epidemic simulation that harmonizes the specification and execution of diverse dynamic epidemiological models within a unified and harmonized architecture. MEmilio couples an efficient C++ simulation core with coherent model descriptions and a user-friendly Python interface, enabling workflows that run on laptops as well as high-performance computing systems. Standardized representations of space, demography, and mobility support straightforward adaptations in resolution and population size, facilitating systematic inter-model comparisons and ensemble studies. The framework integrates readily with established tools for uncertainty quantification and parameter inference, supporting a broad range of applications from scenario exploration to calibration. Finally, strict software-engineering practices, including extensive unit and continuous integration testing, promote robustness and minimize the risk of errors as the framework evolves. By unifying implementations across modeling paradigms, MEmilio aims to lower barriers to reuse and generalize models, enable principled comparisons of implicit assumptions, and accelerate the development of novel approaches that strengthen modeling-based outbreak preparedness.", "AI": {"tldr": "MEmilio\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u7b14\u8bb0\u672c\u7535\u8111\u5230\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5efa\u6a21\u8f6f\u4ef6\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u788e\u7247\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u75ab\u60c5\u548c\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u5e94\u5bf9\u7684\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MEmilio\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u6548\u7684C++\u6a21\u62df\u6838\u5fc3\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53cb\u597d\u7684Python\u63a5\u53e3\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6d41\u884c\u75c5\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u4eba\u53e3\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u65b0\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "conclusion": "MEmilio\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u9690\u542b\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u75ab\u60c5\u5e94\u5bf9\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}
