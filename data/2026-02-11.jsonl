Preprint", "summary": "Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by elevated blood glucose levels due to impaired insulin production or function. Two main forms are recognized: type 1 diabetes (T1D), which involves autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing \\b{eta}-cells, and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which arises from insulin resistance and progressive \\b{eta}-cell dysfunction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases is essential for the development of improved therapeutic strategies, particularly those targeting \\b{eta}-cell dysfunction. To investigate these mechanisms in a controlled and biologically interpretable setting, mouse models have played a central role in diabetes research. Owing to their genetic and physiological similarity to humans, together with the ability to precisely manipulate their genome, mice enable detailed investigation of disease progression and gene function. In particular, mouse models have provided critical insights into \\b{eta}-cell development, cellular heterogeneity, and functional failure under diabetic conditions. Building on these experimental advances, this study applies machine learning methods to single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse pancreatic islets. Specifically, we evaluate two supervised approaches identified in the literature; Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), to assess their ability to identify T2D-associated gene expression signatures at single-cell resolution. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, with an emphasis on interpretability and biological relevance"}

Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world single-cell datasets. We introduce scBench, a benchmark of 394 verifiable problems derived from practical scRNA-seq workflows spanning six sequencing platforms and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on eight frontier models shows that accuracy ranges from 29-53%, with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Platform choice affects accuracy as much as model choice, with 40+ percentage point drops on less-documented technologies. scBench complements SpatialBench to cover the two dominant single-cell modalities, serving both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can analyze real scRNA-seq datasets faithfully and reproducibly."}

We present AntigenLM, a generative DNA language model pretrained on influenza genomes with intact, aligned functional units. This structure-aware pretraining enables AntigenLM to capture evolutionary constraints and generalize across tasks. Fine-tuned on time-series hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences, AntigenLM accurately forecasts future antigenic variants across regions and subtypes, including those unseen during training, outperforming phylogenetic and evolution-based models. It also achieves near-perfect subtype classification. Ablation studies show that disrupting genomic structure through fragmentation or shuffling severely degrades performance, revealing the importance of preserving functional-unit integrity in DNA language modeling. AntigenLM thus provides both a powerful framework for antigen evolution prediction and a general principle for building biologically grounded DNA foundation models."}

We recognize the efforts put into this research and appreciate its contribution to the field. However, we feel that key claims in the study are overly bold, not properly backed by evidence and lack a cautious and nuanced discussion. We hope these points will be taken into account in future discussions and refinements of population estimation methodologies. We argue that the reported bias figures are less caused by actual undercounting of rural populations, but more so by contestable methodological decisions and the historic misallocation of (gridded) population estimates on the local level."}
