To do so, we study evolutionary dynamics in which individuals experience mutations, reproduction, and selection using variants of the Moran model. We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory. Finally, we show that the mapping extends beyond the class of Moran models."}

Here, we present two stochastic maps that unify phenomenological models by integrating fluctuating single-cell growth rates and size-dependent noise mechanisms with cell size control. One map is applicable to mother machine lineages and the other to lineage trees of exponentially-growing cell populations, which reveals that population dynamics alter size control measured in mother machine experiments. For example, an adder can become more sizer-like or more timer-like at the population level depending on the noise statistics. Our analysis of bacterial data identifies extrinsic noise as the dominant mechanism of size variability, characterized by a quadratic conditional variance-mean relationship for division size across growth conditions. This finding contradicts the reported independence of added size relative to birth size but is consistent with the adder property in terms of the independence of the mean added size. Finally, we derive a trade-off between population-growth-rate gain and division-size noise. Correlations between size control quantifiers and single-cell growth rates inferred from data indicate that bacteria prioritize a narrow division-size distribution over growth rate maximisation."}

Pathological variations, particularly in bicuspid aortic valves (BAVs), alter leaflet loading, increase strain, and accelerate disease progression. Accurate, patient-specific characterization of valve geometry and deformation is essential for predicting disease progression and guiding durable repair. Current imaging and computational methods often fail to capture rapid valve motion and complex patient-specific features. To address these challenges, we combined image registration with finite element method (FEM) to enhance AV tracking and biomechanical assessment. Patient-specific valve geometries from 4D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and CT were used in FEM to model AV closure and generate intermediate deformation states. The FEM-generated states facilitated leaflet tracking, while the registration algorithm corrected mismatches between simulation and image. Across 20 patients, FEM-augmented registration improved accuracy by 40% compared with direct registration (33% for TEE, 46% for CT). This improvement enabled more reliable strain estimation directly from imaging and reducing uncertainties from boundary conditions and material assumptions. Areal and Green-Lagrange strains, as well as effective strain, were quantified in adult trileaflet/bicuspid, and pediatric patients. Trileaflet adults showed uniform deformation, BAVs exhibited asymmetric strain, and pediatric valves had low mean areal strain with high variability. Convergence between trileaflet adult and pediatric valves in mean effective strain suggests volumetric deformation drives age- and size-related differences. The FEM-augmented registration framework enhances geometric tracking and provides clinically relevant insights into patient-specific AV deformation, supporting individualized intervention planning."}

An aspect of these analyses is determining which receptors expand or contract statistically significantly as a function of an exogenous perturbation such as therapeutic intervention. We characterize the commonly used Fisher's exact test approach for such analyses and propose an alternative formulation that does not necessitate pairwise, within-patient comparisons. We develop this flexible Bayesian longitudinal mixture model that accommodates variable length patient followup and handles missingness where present, not omitting data in estimation because of structural practicalities. Once clones are partitioned by the model into dynamic (expanding or contracting) and static categories, one can associate their counts or other characteristics with disease state, interventions, baseline biomarkers, and patient prognosis. We apply these developments to a cohort of prostate cancer patients who underwent randomized metastasis-directed therapy or not. Our analyses reveal a significant increase in clonal expansions among MDT patients and their association with later progressions both independent and within strata of MDT. Analysis of receptor motifs and VJ gene enrichment combinations using a high-dimensional penalized log-linear model we develop also suggests distinct biological characteristics of expanding clones, with and without inducement by MDT."}
