We analyze the static sensing limits of mixed Tar/Tsr chemoreceptor clusters in individual Escherichia coli cells using a heterogeneous Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. By sweeping a seven-dimensional parameter space, we compute three sensing performance metrics-channel capacity, effective Hill coefficient, and dynamic range. Across E. coli-like parameter regimes, we consistently observe pronounced local maxima of channel capacity, whereas neither the effective Hill coefficient nor the dynamic range exhibit comparable optimization. The capacity-achieving input distribution is bimodal, which implies that individual cells maximize information by sampling both low- and high concentration regimes. Together, these results suggest that, at the individual-cell level, channel capacity may be selected for in E. coli receptor clusters."}

(moraceae)", "comment": "Masters dissertation submitted to the Graduate Program in Natural Products Chemistry, Institute of Natural Products Research, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), as part of the requirements for obtaining the degree of Master of Science", "summary": "Ficus maxima (Moraceae, subgenus Pharmacosycea), known in Brazil as \"caxinguba\", occurs in northern Brazil and in Mato Grosso. Its leaves and fruits are important food sources for birds and mammals, and the species is traditionally used by Indigenous peoples of Central and South America to treat intestinal parasites, gingivitis, internal inflammation, and snakebites. Despite its medicinal relevance, studies on its chemistry and biological properties are still limited. This work aimed to characterize the chemical constituents of F. maxima leaves and stem bark using UPLC-MS-MS and to evaluate the antinociceptive activity and CYP1A inhibition of ethanolic extracts and fractions. Plant material collected in Abaetetuba, Para (October 2013), was extracted and fractionated by silica gel column chromatography. UPLC-MS-MS analyses in positive and negative ion modes enabled putative metabolite identification supported by MS/MS libraries and molecular networking on GNPS. A total of 45 metabolites were identified, including flavonoids, triterpenes, coumarins, polyunsaturated fatty acids, amino acids, and alkaloids. Major constituents in the leaf extract included triterpene 51, flavonoids 75 and 70, and alkaloid 29. The stem bark ethanolic extract showed marked antinociceptive activity in the inflammatory phase of the formalin test (muscarinic pathway) and 62.6 +/- 9.2% activity in the hot-plate test (opioid pathway). The dichloromethane fraction of the leaves exhibited potent CYP1A1 inhibitory activity in vitro. These findings support the traditional use of F. maxima as an anti-inflammatory resource and associate its major constituents with the observed activities, reinforcing its potential as a therapeutic source that deserves further investigation."}

Demographic eco-evolutionary game dynamics under the impact of the delay resulting from the offspring maturation time", "comment": null, "summary": "In this paper, we extend the demographic eco-evolutionary game approach, based on explicit birth and death dynamics instead of abstract \"fitness\" interpreted as an abstract \"Malthusian parameter\", by the introduction of the delay resulting from the juvenile maturation time. This leads to the application of the Delay Differential Equations (DDE). We show that delay seriously affects the resulting dynamics and may lead to the loss of stability of equilibria when critical delay is exceeded. We provide theoretical tools for the assessment of the critical delays and the parameter values when this may happen. Our results emphasize the importance of the mechanisms of density dependence. We analyze the impact of three different suppression modes based on: adult mortality, juvenile recruitment survival after the maturation period (without delay), and juvenile recruitment at birth (with the delay). The last mode leads to extreme patterns such as bifurcations, complex cycles, and chaotic dynamics. However, surprisingly, this mode leads to extension of the duration of the temporary transient metastable states known as \"ghost attractors\". In addition, we also focus on the problem of resilience of the analyzed systems against external periodic perturbations and feedback-driven factors such as additional predator pressure."}
