In this setting, data harmonization techniques are typically employed to address systematic biases and ensure the interoperability of the data. State-of-the-art harmonisation approaches are based on the statistical theory of random effect modeling, allowing to account for either linear of non-linear biases and batch effects. However, optimizing these statistical methods generally requires data centralization at some point during the analysis pipeline, therefore introducing the risk of exposing individual patient information while posing significant data governance issues. To overcome this challenge, in this paper we present Fed-ComBat, a federated framework for batch effect harmonization on decentralized data. Fed-ComBat enables the preservation of nonlinear covariate effects without requiring centralization of data and without prior parametric hypothesis on the variables to account for. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Fed-ComBat against a comprehensive panel of existing approaches based on the state-of-the-art ComBat, along with distributed and nonlinear variants. Our experiments are based on extensive simulated data, and on the analysis of multiple cohorts based on 7 neuroimaging studies comprising healthy controls (CI) and subjects with various disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Our results show that in a federated settings, Fed-ComBat harmonization exhibits comparable results to centralized methods for both linear and nonlinear cases. On real data, harmonized trajectories of the thickness ofthe right hippocampus across lifespan measured on a set of 7 public studies show comparable results between centralized and federated models and are consistent with the literature when using a nonlinear model.

The central assumption of these models is that metabolism operates at a steady state, meaning that the production and consumption rates of each metabolite are balanced. This assumption imposes linear constraints on the fluxes of biochemical reactions. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA), a fundamental method in the field, is formulated as an optimization problem maximizing a cellular objective (e.g., growth) over the resulting linear subspace of steady state fluxes. Many other methods in the field are expressed either as a modification to FBA, or use FBA as a black box within an algorithm. Here, we propose a simple and general alternative to optimization that, for any flux vector, finds the closest flux distribution within the steady-state subspace. This operation corresponds to an orthogonal projection that enforces the steady-state assumption. We further introduce extensions to handle cases involving unknown or fixed fluxes through modified projections and tailored affine subspaces. The overall approach is computationally efficient, does not require a cellular objective, and is easy to implement. We validate our method and its variants on both synthetic and experimental datasets, demonstrating their speed and utility for denoising and imputing metabolic flux data, and for predicting steady-state fluxes from more readily available types of data.\n  Code availability: The code implementing FBApro is available at https://github.com/Singh-Lab/FBApro.

Over the past decades several computational methods have been developed to decipher emergent multi-cellular behaviors. In particular agent-based (or cell-based) models that consider the individual cell as basic modeling unit tracked in space and time enjoy increasing interest across scientific communities. In this article we explore a particular class of cell-based models, so-called Deformable Cell Models (DCMs), that allow to simulate the biophysics of the cell with high realism. After situating this model among other model types, We give an overview of past and recent DCM developments and discuss new simulation results of several applications covering in-vitro and in-vivo systems. Our goal is to demonstrate how such models can generate quantitative added value in biological and biotechnological problems."}

Unlike traditional clustering problems, biological sequence clustering faces unique challenges due to the lack of direct similarity measures, strict biological constraints, and demanding requirements for both scalability and accuracy. Over the past decades, a wide variety of methods have been developed, differing in how they model sequence similarity, construct clusters, and prioritize optimization objectives. In this review, we provide a comprehensive methodological overview of biological sequence clustering algorithms. We begin by summarizing the main strategies for modeling sequence similarity, which can be divided into three stages: sequence encoding, feature generation, and similarity measurement. Next, we discuss the major clustering paradigms, including greedy incremental, hierarchical, graph-based, model-based, partitional, and deep learning approaches, highlighting their methodological characteristics and practical trade-offs. We then discuss clustering objectives from three key perspectives: scalability and resource efficiency, biological interpretability, and robustness and clustering quality. Organizing existing methods along these dimensions allows us to explore the trade-offs in biological sequence clustering and clarify the contexts in which different approaches are most appropriate. Finally, we identify current limitations and challenges, providing guidance for researchers and directions for future method development."}

Rock", "Louise Dyson"], "title": "Early warning signals of non-critical transitions from linearised time-varying dynamics with applications to epidemic systems", "comment": null, "summary": "In the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, there has been heightened interest from applied mathematicians in infectious disease modelling. Modelling efforts often focus on predicting whether diseases are likely to be eliminated or, instead, (re-)emerge, especially as a result of control measures.This tipping point between elimination and infection waves has been successfully anticipated in the literature through the use of early warning signals and such signals often rely on the theory of critical slowing down. Recent developments have shown that these signals (increases in fluctuation variance and return time) can emerge from the system geometry in the case of non-normal dynamics rather than a change in asymptotic stability. We show how such dynamical behaviour occurs in the fluctuations from the mean-field in general stochastic systems. Using the susceptible-infectious-recovered model as an example application, we analyse how critical-like behaviour can be exploited to anticipate infection waves in the absence of an equilibrium bifurcation."}

Deep convolutional and attention based models achieve strong in distribution performance on DNA regulatory sequence prediction tasks but are usually evaluated under i.i.d. assumptions, even though real applications involve cell type specific programs, evolutionary turnover, assay protocol changes, and sequencing artifacts. We introduce a robustness framework that combines a mechanistic simulation benchmark with real data analysis on a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) dataset to quantify performance degradation, calibration failures, and uncertainty based reliability. In simulation, motif driven regulatory outputs are generated with cell type specific programs, PWM perturbations, GC bias, depth variation, batch effects, and heteroscedastic noise, and CNN, BiLSTM, and transformer models are evaluated. Models remain accurate and reasonably calibrated under mild GC content shifts but show higher error, severe variance miscalibration, and coverage collapse under motif effect rewiring and noise dominated regimes, revealing robustness gaps invisible to standard i.i.d. evaluation. Adding simple biological structural priors motif derived features in simulation and global GC content in MPRA improves in distribution error and yields consistent robustness gains under biologically meaningful genomic shifts, while providing only limited protection against strong assay noise. Uncertainty-aware selective prediction offers an additional safety layer that risk coverage analyses on simulated and MPRA data show that filtering low confidence inputs recovers low risk subsets, including under GC-based out-of-distribution conditions, although reliability gains diminish when noise dominates."}

Established models often focus on pairwise species interactions, yet recent studies have highlighted the importance of higher-order interactions (HOIs) in shaping community structure and function. In this study, we investigate the effects of HOIs in an agent-based model with three species engaged in intransitive competition. We introduce an HOI where one species modifies the competition between the other two. We explore the impact of the strength, radius of influence, and speed of this interaction modification on species abundances and oscillations thereof. Our results show that these abundances are not only greatly impacted by the strength, but also by the radius and speed of the interaction modification. A deeper investigation demonstrates that the changes in the oscillations are caused by the interaction modification itself, and not the change in pairwise interaction strength caused by the HOI. These results emphasize the importance of considering the spatio-temporal scales of higher-order interactions when assessing ecosystem stability, highlighting that such interactions can introduce complex dynamical behaviors that go beyond the predictions of traditional pairwise or simpler higher-order models"}

Numerous (im)balance indices have been proposed to quantify the (im)balance of rooted trees. A recent comprehensive survey summarized this literature and showed that many existing indices are based on similar underlying principles. To unify these approaches, three general metaconcepts were introduced, providing a framework to classify, analyze, and extend imbalance indices. In this context, a metaconcept is a function $Φ_f$ that depends on another function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape. In this manuscript, we extend this line of research by introducing a new metaconcept based on the heights of the pending subtrees of all inner vertices. We provide a thorough analysis of this metaconcept and use it to answer open questions concerning the well-known $B_1$ balance index. In particular, we characterize the tree shapes that maximize the $B_1$ index in two cases: (i) arbitrary rooted trees and (ii) binary rooted trees. For both cases, we also determine the corresponding maximum values of the index.\n  Finally, while the $B_1$ index is induced by a so-called third-order metaconcept, we explicitly introduce three new (im)balance indices derived from the first- and second-order height metaconcepts, respectively, thereby demonstrating that pending subtree heights give rise to a variety of novel (im)balance indices."}
