We introduce ECGomics, a systematic paradigm and open-source platform for the multidimensional deconstruction of cardiac signals into digital biomarker. Methods: Inspired by the taxonomic rigor of genomics, ECGomics deconstructs cardiac activity across four dimensions: Structural, Intensity, Functional, and Comparative. This taxonomy synergizes expert-defined morphological rules with data-driven latent representations, effectively bridging the gap between handcrafted features and deep learning embeddings. Results: We operationalized this framework into a scalable ecosystem consisting of a web-based research platform and a mobile-integrated solution (https://github.com/PKUDigitalHealth/ECGomics). The web platform facilitates high-throughput analysis via precision parameter configuration, high-fidelity data ingestion, and 12-lead visualization, allowing for the systematic extraction of biomarkers across the four ECGomics dimensions. Complementarily, the mobile interface, integrated with portable sensors and a cloud-based engine, enables real-time signal acquisition and near-instantaneous delivery of structured diagnostic reports. This dual-interface architecture successfully transitions ECGomics from theoretical discovery to decentralized, real-world health management, ensuring professional-grade monitoring in diverse clinical and home-based settings. Conclusion: ECGomics harmonizes diagnostic precision, interpretability, and data efficiency. By providing a deployable software ecosystem, this paradigm establishes a robust foundation for digital biomarker discovery and personalized cardiovascular medicine."}

Santos"], "title": "Final size of a structured SIRD Model with active-population force of infection", "comment": null, "summary": "We consider a SIRD epidemic model for a population composed of two groups of individuals with asymmetric interactions, where the force of infection depends on the active (alive) population in each group, rather than on the total population, as in the classical formulation. We prove that the final state for susceptible individuals is always positive and characterize it as the unique fixed point of a map. We also relate the final size to the basic reproduction number and show that the final number of susceptibles decreases when transmission rates increase. Numerical simulations compare the active-population and classical two-group SIRD models, showing differences in final size and the occurrence of multiple epidemic waves. The convergence of the fixed point approach is also illustrated."}

The success of these applications depends on accurately determining phage host range, which is often specific at the strain level rather than the species level. However, existing computational approaches face major limitations: many rely on genus-specific features that do not generalize across taxa, while others require large amounts of training data that are unavailable for most bacterial lineages. These challenges create a critical need for methods that can accurately predict strain-level phage-host interactions across diverse bacterial genera, particularly under data-limited conditions. We present PhageMind, a learning framework designed to address this challenge by enabling efficient transfer of knowledge across bacterial genera. PhageMind is trained to identify shared principles of phage-bacterium interactions from well-studied systems and to rapidly adapt these principles to new genera using only a small number of known interactions. To reflect the biological basis of infection, we represent phage-host relationships using a knowledge graph that explicitly incorporates phage tail fiber proteins and bacterial O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters, and we use this representation to guide interaction prediction. Across four bacterial genera (Escherichia, Klebsiella, Vibrio, and Alteromonas), PhageMind achieves high prediction accuracy and shows strong adaptability to new lineages. In particular, in leave-one-genus-out evaluations, the model maintains robust performance when only limited reference data are available, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and practical tool for studying phage-host interactions across the global phageome."}

In typical models of collective motion, each individual takes the average direction of multiple neighbors, resulting in ordered movement. In small flocks, noise induced order can also emerge with individuals copying only a randomly chosen single neighbor at a time. We propose a new model of collective movement, inspired by how real animals move, where individuals can move in two directions or remain stationary. We demonstrate that when individuals interact with a single neighbor through a novel form of halting interaction -- where an individual may stop upon encountering an oppositely moving neighbor rather than instantly aligning -- persistent collective order can emerge even in large populations. This represents a fundamentally different mechanism from conventional averaging-based or noise-induced ordering. Using deterministic and stochastic mean-field approximations, we characterize the conditions under which such ``flocking by stopping'' behavior can occur, and confirm the mean-field predictions using individual-based simulations. Our results highlight how incorporating a stopped state and halting interactions can generate new routes to order in collective movement."}

We show that the likelihood function associated with this model has a unique maximum which depends analytically of the parameters (as it was conjectured in ChorHendySnir2006), assuming that these parameters verify some very precise inequalities; some of which arise naturally from the model. With a typical argument of differential topology we reduce the proof to answer a question of algebra, very simple, although computationally involved, that we solve using some Maple libraries. We are very indebted to Marta Casanellas, who presented the problem to us and gave us the first insights on it."}
