Unfortunately, the studies based on these attempts often overlooked the serious issues that can arise when quantifying biodiversity effects at larger scales, specifically the fact that biodiversity effects measured across space and time can contain trivial effects that are unrelated to the role of biodiversity per se -- or even effects that are non-biological in nature due to being simple artefacts of how properties and entities are counted and quantified. Here we outline and describe three such pseudo-biodiversity effects: Population-level effects, Independence effects, and Arithmetic effects. Population-level effects are those related to temporal changes due to individual species population growth or development, and are thus independent of biodiversity. Independence and Arithmetic effects (which we explore here primarily in a spatial context) arise either as a simple consequence of the fact that not all species are present everywhere -- i.e., species turnover is inevitable at greater spatial scales (Independence effects); or they arise when the purported biodiversity effects measured are a simple byproduct of how mathematical functions behave (Arithmetic effects). Our study demonstrates the necessity of controlling for these trivial artefactual effects if one wishes to meaningfully measure how true biodiversity effects change across spatial and temporal scales."}

Recently, in this framework the action of the external force field has been introduction in order to gain a more realistic picture of some phenomena. In this paper, we introduce nonconservative kinetic equations where a particular shape external force field acts on the overall system. Then, this framework is used in an ecological context for modeling the evolution of a system composed of two species interacting with a prey-predator mechanism. The linear stability analysis concerned with the coexistence equilibrium point is provided, and a case where a Hopf bifurcations occurs is discussed. Finally, some relevant scenarios are numerically simulated."}

The dispersal area ($A$) plays a crucial role in this process, as it determines the probability of finding colonizable vacant sites. We investigated the spatial colonization-extinction dynamics in a lattice model (a contact process), exploring various finite dispersal areas and estimating the extinction threshold $λ_E(A)$. Our results revealed a consistent $λ_E(A)$ relationship, largely independent of lattice geometry (except for the smallest $A$). This $λ_E(A)$ relationship obeyed universal scaling laws within two broad ranges of $A$. The scaling relations suggest considerable selection upon the increase of dispersal area, particularly at low $A$ values. We discuss these findings in the broader context of the evolution of dispersal area."}

In this paper we focus on a best bandwidth selection method for use in an analogue of a classical KDE using the tropical symmetric distance, known as a tropical KDE, for use over the space of phylogenetic trees. We propose the likelihood cross validation (LCV) for selecting the bandwidth parameter for the KDE over the space of phylogenetic trees. In this paper, first, we show the explicit optimal solution of the best-fit bandwidth parameter via the LCV for tropical KDE over the space of phylogenetic trees. Then, computational experiments with simulated datasets generated under the multi-species coalescent (MSC) model show that a tropical KDE with the best-fit bandwidth parameter via the LCV perform better than a tropical KDE with an estimated best-fit bandwidth parameter via nearest neighbors in terms of accuracy and computational time. Lastly, we apply our method an empirical data from the Apicomplexa genome."}

This study presents a domain-adapted system powered by large language models (LLMs) and guided by advanced prompt engineering techniques to automate the identification of nutraceutical-producing microbes from unstructured scientific text. By leveraging few-shot prompting and tailored query designs, the system demonstrates robust performance across multiple configurations, with DeepSeekV3 outperforming LLaMA2 in accuracy, especially when domain-specific strain information is included. A structured and validated dataset comprising 35 nutraceutical-strain associations was generated, spanning amino acids, fibers, phytochemicals, and vitamins. The results reveal significant microbial diversity across monoculture and co-culture systems, with dominant contributions from Corynebacterium glutamicum, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus subtilis, alongside emerging synthetic consortia. This AI-driven framework not only enhances the scalability and interpretability of literature mining but also provides actionable insights for microbial strain selection, synthetic biology design, and precision fermentation strategies in the production of high-value nutraceuticals."}

Current benchmarks suffer from critical deficiencies, such as data contamination due to outdated test sets, insufficient focus on essential protein-specific tasks, and a neglect of multimodal assessments. To resolve these issues, we introduce LiveProteinBench, a contamination-free, multimodal benchmark of 12 tasks for evaluating LLM performance on protein property and function prediction. Its central innovation lies in a test set composed exclusively of proteins validated after the start of 2025, guaranteeing that the data is novel to all tested models. We benchmarked a suite of prominent general-purpose LLMs and specialized biological LLMs using both unimodal and multimodal input schemes. Our results show that: 1) General-purpose proprietary large models demonstrate superior zero-shot performance when encountering new protein data, outperforming their open-source and domain-specific counterparts by over 20\\% accuracy. 2) The effective use of multi-view structural information remains a significant challenge, as the inclusion of structural images often fails to provide a consistent benefit and can even degrade performance. This highlights the limitations of current models in effectively fusing information across different modalities. 3) Models' performance scales more directly with the computational cost during inference than with its parameter count, underscoring the critical role of Chain-of-Thought reasoning capabilities for protein-specific tasks. LiveProteinBench delineates the current performance frontiers for LLMs in bioinformatics and presents new challenges for the development of future multimodal foundation models for biology"}

We present INSIGHT, a graph neural network that predicts survival directly from routine histology images. Trained and cross-validated on TCGA (n=342) and SURGEN (n=336), INSIGHT produces patient-level spatially resolved risk scores. Large independent validation showed superior prognostic performance compared with pTNM staging (C-index 0.68-0.69 vs 0.44-0.58). INSIGHT spatial risk maps recapitulated canonical prognostic histopathology and identified nuclear solidity and circularity as quantitative risk correlates. Integrating spatial risk with data-driven spatial transcriptomic signatures, spatial proteomics, bulk RNA-seq, and single-cell references revealed an epithelium-immune risk manifold capturing epithelial dedifferentiation and fetal programs, myeloid-driven stromal states including $\\mathrm{SPP1}^{+}$ macrophages and $\\mathrm{LAMP3}^{+}$ dendritic cells, and adaptive immune dysfunction. This analysis exposed patient-specific epithelial heterogeneity, stratification within MSI-High tumours, and high-risk routes of CDX2/HNF4A loss and CEACAM5/6-associated proliferative programs, highlighting coordinated therapeutic vulnerabilities."}

GitHub repo coming shortly", "summary": "Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging. Here, we extend this framework using information-theoretical measures to elucidate underlying mechanisms. In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures. We identify dual coupling mechanisms at the short-term (0.5 - 2.5 s), but not long-term (2.5 - 5 s) time scales: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity - a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance was observed in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetuses and independent of sex or stress. We provide insight into the dependence of these findings on the sampling rate of the underlying data, identifying 4 Hz, commonly used for ultrasound-derived fetal heart rate recordings, as the necessary and sufficient sampling rate regime to capture the information flow. Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating causal foundations. Future studies should explore additional information-theoretical conditional approaches to resolve stress-specific and time-scale-specific differences in information flow."}

Single-objective light-sheet approaches based on oblique plane microscopy (OPM) are well suited for live imaging in standard sample geometries, but most existing implementations lack the optical calibration, timing precision, and end-to-end integration required for reproducible quantitative measurements. Here we present a fully integrated and quantitatively characterized OPM platform engineered for dynamic studies of transcription and nuclear organization in embryos, embryonic stem cells, and three-dimensional culture systems. The system combines high numerical aperture remote refocusing with tilt-invariant light-sheet scanning and hardware-timed synchronization of laser excitation, galvo scanning, and camera readout. We provide a comprehensive characterization of the optical performance, including point spread function, sampling geometry, usable field of view, and system stability, establishing a well-defined framework for quantitative volumetric imaging. To support high-throughput operation, we developed a unified acquisition and reconstruction pipeline that enables real time volumetric imaging at hardware-limited rates while preserving deterministic timing and reproducible geometry. Using this platform, we demonstrate quantitative three-dimensional imaging of MS2-labeled transcription sites in living Drosophila embryos, cultured mouse embryonic stem cells, and mESC-derived gastruloids, enabling extraction of transcriptional intensity traces across diverse biological contexts. This work establishes OPM as a robust and quantitatively calibrated single-objective light-sheet platform for transcription imaging in complex living systems."}
