Rasel", "Sameem Abdul Kareem", "Unaizah Obaidellah"], "title": "Integrating Color Histogram Analysis and Convolutional Neural Network for Skin Lesion Classification", "comment": null, "summary": "The color of skin lesions is an important diagnostic feature for identifying malignant melanoma and other skin diseases. Typical colors associated with melanocytic lesions include tan, brown, black, red, white, and blue gray. This study introduces a novel feature: the number of colors present in a lesion, which can indicate the severity of disease and help distinguish melanomas from benign lesions. We propose a color histogram analysis method to examine lesion pixel values from three publicly available datasets: PH2, ISIC2016, and Med Node. The PH2 dataset contains ground truth annotations of lesion colors, while ISIC2016 and Med Node do not; our algorithm estimates the ground truth using color histogram analysis based on PH2. We then design and train a 19 layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with residual skip connections to classify lesions into three categories based on the number of colors present. DeepDream visualization is used to interpret features learned by the network, and multiple CNN configurations are tested. The best model achieves a weighted F1 score of 75 percent. LIME is applied to identify important regions influencing model decisions. The results show that the number of colors in a lesion is a significant feature for describing skin conditions, and the proposed CNN with three skip connections demonstrates strong potential for clinical diagnostic support."}

Part 2: Theory and future challenges", "comment": "Invited review (Part II of a two-part series), submitted to Current Opinion in Genetics & Development. Part I is available at arXiv:2601.19681", "summary": "Promoters and enhancers are cis-regulatory elements (CREs), DNA sequences that bind transcription factor (TF) proteins to up- or down-regulate target genes. Decades-long efforts yielded TF-DNA interaction models that predict how strongly an individual TF binds arbitrary DNA sequences and how individual binding events on the CRE combine to affect gene expression. These insights can be synthesized into a global, biophysically-realistic, and quantitative genotype-phenotype (GP) map for gene regulation, a \"holy grail\" for the application of evolutionary theory. A global map provides a rare opportunity to simulate long-term evolution of regulatory sequences and pose several fundamental questions: How long does it take to evolve CREs de novo? How many non-trivial regulatory functions exist in sequence space? How connected are they? For which regulatory architecture is CRE evolution most rapid and evolvable? In this article, the second of a two-part series, we review the application of evolutionary concepts - epistasis, robustness, evolvability, tunability, plasticity, and bet-hedging - to the evolution of gene regulatory sequences. We then evaluate the potential for a unifying theory for the evolution of regulatory sequences, and identify key open challenges."}

While recent GAN-based image restoration formulations have introduced frequency-domain losses for natural images, microscopy images pose distinct challenges with large dynamic ranges and sparse but critical structures with spatially-variable contrast. Inspired by the principle of logarithmic perception in human vision, we propose a log focal frequency loss (LFFL) tailored for microscopy restoration. This loss combines adaptive spectral weighting from log-space differences with log-dampened error measurement, ensuring balanced reconstruction across all frequency bands while preserving both structural coherence and fine details. We tested our GAN-based framework on two use-cases with real ground-truths: deblurring of fluorescence images of cell nuclei on microgroove substrates and denoising of zebrafish embryo images from the FMD dataset. Compared to training with only spatial-domain losses and with existing frequency-domain losses, our method achieves improvements across several quality metrics. Code is available at github.com/xjzhaang/log-focal-frequency-loss."}

Although existing computational approaches have been proposed for site-of-metabolism prediction, they typically ignore cytochrome P450 isoform identity or model isoforms independently, thereby failing to fully capture inherent cross-isoform metabolic patterns. In addition, prior evaluations often rely on top-k metrics, where false positive atoms may be included among the top predictions, underscoring the need for complementary metrics that more directly assess binary atom-level discrimination under severe class imbalance. We propose ATTNSOM, an atom-level site-of-metabolism prediction framework that integrates intrinsic molecular reactivity with cross-isoform relationships. The model combines a shared graph encoder, molecule-conditioned atom representations, and a cross-attention mechanism to capture correlated metabolic patterns across cytochrome P450 isoforms. The model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets annotated with site-of-metabolism labels at atom resolution. Across these benchmarks, the model achieves consistently strong top-k performance across multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms. Relative to ablated variants, the model yields higher Matthews correlation coefficient, indicating improved discrimination of true metabolic sites. These results support the importance of explicitly modeling cross-isoform relationships for site-of-metabolism prediction. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/dmis-lab/ATTNSOM."}
