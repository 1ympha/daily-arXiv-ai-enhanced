The 5F-MDL strategy integrates an ensemble of 33 deep learning sub-models to construct a 33-dimensional property spectrum that quantifies the global phenotypic alignment of candidate molecules with clinically approved drugs along five axes: physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, and stability. Using drug-likeness scores derived from this 33-dimensional profile, we prioritized 15 high-potential molecules from a 16-million-molecule library. Experimental validation demonstrated that the lead compound M2 not only exhibits potent antibacterial activity, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25.6 ug/mL, but also achieves binding stability superior to cefuroxime, as indicated by Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculations of -38.54 kcal/mol and a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.8 A. This strategy could overcome scaffold constraints and offers an efficient route for discovering lead compounds with favorable prospects against drug-resistant bacteria."}

The rising incidence of these mycoses is linked to climate shifts, demographic changes, and social determinants of health. However, the actual burden of these infections is often underestimated by traditional surveillance methods. Therefore, this study aims to characterize these infections within the All of Us Research Program and evaluate the quality of clinical and health data related to fungal infections. We constructed three fungi cohorts of Coccidioidomycosis (n=1,173), Aspergillosis (n=687), and Histoplasmosis (n=345) among over 400,000 participants using electronic health record data. We analyzed geographic and sociodemographic distributions and performed a data quality assessment on ten key laboratory biomarkers to evaluate data completeness, unit conformance, and measurement concordance within a 90-day window of diagnosis. Our analysis confirmed known epidemiological patterns, including the geographic distributions of Coccidioidomycosis in the Southwest and Histoplasmosis in the Midwest. Fungal infections disproportionately affected older adults, males, and White non-Hispanic individuals. The data quality assessment revealed high completeness for general hematology markers (e.g., Hemoglobin > 70%) but limited availability for biomarkers, such as Beta 1,3 Glucan (< 15%). While measurement concordance was strong (e.g., hemoglobin-hematocrit correlation, r = 0.94), unit conformance was poor for key inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In conclusion, the All of Us dataset is a valuable resource for characterizing fungal infections. However, significant data quality issues related to completeness and conformance for specialized biomarkers must be addressed to enhance their applicability for robust clinical research."}

While considerable research has focused on optimizing analyte transport and binding kinetics, a fundamental parameter - sample volume - remains largely underexplored in biosensor design. This is critical because biosensor performance depends on the absolute number of target molecules present, not solely their concentration, making volume a key consideration where sample availability is limited. To address this gap, we developed a tractable two-compartment mathematical model integrating simplified mass transport, Langmuir binding kinetics, and mass conservation under finite volume constraints. Validated against experimental measurements and numerical simulations, the model accurately predicts critical performance metrics including assay time and minimum required sample volume while achieving more than a 10,000-fold reduction in computational time compared to commercial simulation packages. Through systematic analysis, we derived quantitative design rules for biosensor optimization that explicitly account for measurement time and sample volume as primary decision variables. We validated this framework experimentally by optimizing flow rate parameters for a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor and retrospectively applied it to enhance sensitivity of published biosensor designs. Released as open-source software, our model enables researchers to gain mechanistic insights, optimize device performance, and make informed design decisions tailored to specific healthcare contexts, including point-of-care testing and resource-constrained environments."}

Murat Maga", "Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin"], "title": "MorphoCloud: Democratizing Access to High-Performance Computing for Morphological Data Analysis", "comment": "13 pages, 3 tables, 2 figures", "summary": "The digitization of biological specimens has revolutionized the field of morphology, creating large collections of 3D data, and microCT in particular. This revolution was initially supported by the development of open-source software tools, specifically the development of SlicerMorph extension to the open-source image analytics platform 3D Slicer. Through SlicerMorph and 3D Slicer, biologists, morphologists and scientists in related fields have all the necessary tools to import, visualize and analyze these complex and large datasets in a single platform that is flexible and expandible, without the need of proprietary software that hinders scientific collaboration and sharing.\n  Yet, a significant \"compute gap\" remains: While data and software are now open and accessible, the necessary high-end computing resources to run them are often not equally accessible in all institutions, and particularly lacking at Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and other educational settings. Here, we present MorphoCloud, an \"IssuesOps\"-based platform that leverages Github Actions and the JetStream2 cloud farm to provide on-demand, research-grade computing environments to researchers working with 3D morphological datasets. By delivering a GPU-accelerated full desktop experience via a web browser, MorphoCloud eliminates hardware barriers, enabling complex 3D analysis and AI-assisted segmentation. This paper explains the platform and its architecture, as well as use cases it is designed to support."}

Computing distances based on them, however, is often intractable, so the efficiently computable Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance is used in practice. We investigate how the RF distance behaves along paths in the NNI and SPR graphs, where trees are nodes, edges represent single rearrangements. We show that any two trees are connected by a path along which the RF distance to the target decreases monotonically in the NNI graph and strictly in the SPR graph; we also exhibit trees for which no strictly decreasing NNI path exists."}

Classical approaches to characterizing tree space, such as the Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) space, offer elegant geometric structure but suffer from statistical and computational limitations. An alternative perspective arises from tropical geometry, the tropical Grassmannian tropGr(2,n), introduced by Speyer and Sturmfels, which coincides with phylogenetic tree space. In this paper, we review the structure of the tropical Grassmannian and present algorithmic methods for its computational study, including procedures for sampling from the tropical Grassmannian. Our aim is to make these concepts accessible to evolutionary biologists and computational scientists, and to motivate new research directions at the interface of algebraic geometry and phylogenetic inference."}
