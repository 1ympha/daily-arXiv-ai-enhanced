We develop a spatially explicit reaction-diffusion framework to investigate competing species in landscapes shaped by climate variability, pollution, resource heterogeneity, and cooperation. Here, temperature follows low-frequency oscillations, while pollution and resources diffuse from localized sources. Growth is governed by a dynamic carrying capacity integrating abiotic stress with an endogenous, pollution-sensitive cooperation field.\n  Numerical simulations reveal the spontaneous emergence of persistent spatial organization, including dominance segregation and stable competitive boundaries. Quantitative analyses-using boundary geometry, fractal dimension, and spatial entropy-demonstrate a transition from intermixed initial states to low-complexity, quasi-stationary configurations. Coexistence occurs through distinct strategies: one species occupies more area, while the other maintains higher local densities. Cooperation enhances resilience but collapses in polluted zones, creating heterogeneous \"social buffering.\"\n  We further introduce a hybrid inverse modeling framework using a Swin Transformer to infer high-dimensional parameters from only two temporal snapshots. Trained on synthetic data, the model accurately recovers demographic, diffusive, and environmental-sensitivity parameters. While it achieves reliable short-term spatial predictions, long-term forecasts diverge due to the intrinsic sensitivity of nonlinear systems. This unified framework links sparse observations to mechanistic dynamics, advancing biodiversity forecasting under accelerating global change."}

The tools used are graph-theoretic", "summary": "Phylogenetic reconciliation seeks to explain host-symbiont co-evolution by mapping parasite trees onto host trees through events such as cospeciation, duplication, host switching, and loss. Finding an optimal reconciliation that ensures time feasibility is computationally hard when timing information is incomplete, and the complexity remains open when host switches are restricted by a fixed maximum distance $d$. While the case $d=2$ is known to be polynomial, larger values are unresolved. In this paper, we study the cases $d=3$ and $d=4$. We show that although arbitrarily large cycles may occur, it suffices to check only bounded-size cycles (we provide a complete list), provided the reconciliation satisfies acyclicity (i.e., time-feasibility) in a stronger sense. These results do not resolve the general complexity, but highlight structural properties that advance the understanding of distance-bounded reconciliations."}

While genetic drivers are well-characterized, growing evidence suggests that non-genetic mechanisms, particularly those involving drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs), play a pivotal role in solid tumor relapse. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics of DTP-induced resistance, we develop a stochastic agent-based model (ABM) of solid tumor evolution that couples macroscopic population dynamics with microscopic epigenetic state inheritance during the cell cycle. Our simulations accurately reproduce the temporal progression of relapse observed in experimental studies, capturing the dynamic transition from sensitive cells to DTPs, and ultimately to stable resistant phenotypes under prolonged therapy. By explicitly modeling the epigenetic plasticity of individual cells, our model bridges the gap between cellular heterogeneity and population-level tumor evolution. Furthermore, we performed \\textit{in silico} clinical trials using virtual patient cohorts to evaluate therapeutic outcomes, demonstrating that optimized adaptive treatment strategies can significantly delay tumor relapse compared to standard dosing. This study provides a quantitative framework for dissecting DTP-driven resistance mechanisms and designing more effective, biologically informed therapeutic strategies."}

We propose Gengram, a conditional memory module that introduces an explicit and highly efficient lookup primitive for multi-base motifs via a genomic-specific hashing scheme, establishing genomic \"syntax\". Integrated into the backbone of state-of-the-art GFMs, Gengram achieves substantial gains (up to 14%) across several functional genomics tasks. The module demonstrates robust architectural generalization, while further inspection of Gengram's latent space reveals the emergence of meaningful representations that align closely with fundamental biological knowledge. By establishing structured motif memory as a modeling primitive, Gengram simultaneously boosts empirical performance and mechanistic interpretability, providing a scalable and biology-aligned pathway for the next generation of GFMs. The code is available at https://github.com/zhejianglab/Genos, and the model checkpoint is available at https://huggingface.co/ZhejiangLab/Gengram."}

Theoretical studies have mainly focused on Lotka-Volterra models, which do not account for food source dynamics. In contrast, consumer-resource models, which consider food source dynamics, are less explored. In particular, it is still unclear what physical mechanisms control oscillatory dynamics at a single population level, a phenomenon which can only be captured by a consumer-resource model. Here, we present a minimalistic consumer-resource model of a single microbial population with growth and death dynamics, consuming a continuously replenishing substrate. Our model reveals that decaying oscillations can occur around steady state if and only if the timescale of microbial adaptation to food supply changes exceeds the death timescale. This interplay of timescales allows us to rationalize the emergence of oscillatory dynamics when adding various biophysical ingredients to the model. We find that microbial necromass recycling or complementary use of multiple food sources reduces the parameter range for oscillations and increases the decay rate of oscillations. Requiring multiple simultaneous food sources has the opposite effect. Essentially, facilitating growth reduces the likelihood of oscillations around a fixed point. We further demonstrate that such damped oscillatory behavior is correlated with persistent oscillatory behavior in a noisy environment. We hope our work will motivate further investigations of consumer-resource models to improve descriptions of environments where food source distributions vary in space and time."}

Five major variants of concern, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron, have been identified. By August 2022, over 12.95 million full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences had been deposited in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) database, offering an unprecedented opportunity to investigate viral evolution and epistatic interactions. Recent advances in epistatic inference, exemplified by Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) (Zeng et al., Phys. Rev. E, 2022), have generated numerous Circos plots illustrating genetic inter-dependencies. In this study, we constructed a dataset of 1,984 Circos plots and developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework to classify and identify the corresponding genomic variants. The CNN effectively captured complex epistatic features, achieving an accuracy of 99.26\\%. These findings demonstrate that CNN-based models can serve as powerful tools for exploring higher-order genetic dependencies, providing deeper insights into the evolutionary dynamics and adaptive mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2."}
